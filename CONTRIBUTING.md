# Introduction

### Welcome!

>Thank you for considering contributing to InQuick. As a new endeavor, we could use all the help you can provide.

### To Be Effective.

>Following these guidelines helps to ensure that your contributions will be incorporated into the project. All contributors should assist in addressing issues, assessing changes, and helping with pull requests.

### What We Need.

> There are many ways to contribute, but our main needs are for improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, and actual code contributions.

### Ground Rules

> Responsibilities
* Ensure cross-browser compatibility for every change that's accepted. Yes, even IE.
* Create issues for any major changes and enhancements that you wish to make. 
* Discuss things transparently and get community feedback.
* Don't add any classes to the codebase unless absolutely needed. Err on the side of using functions.
* Keep feature versions as small as possible, preferably one new feature per version.
* Be welcoming to newcomers and encourage diverse new contributors from all backgrounds. See the [Python Community Code of Conduct](https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/).

### Your First Contribution

> Unsure where to start? You can start by looking through the issues. The following links may help you to start: http://makeapullrequest.com/, http://www.firsttimersonly.com/, and [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

>At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

>If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.

# Getting started
### Give them a quick walkthrough of how to submit a contribution.
How you write this is up to you, but some things you may want to include:

* Let them know if they need to sign a CLA, agree to a DCO, or get any other legal stuff out of the way
* If tests are required for contributions, let them know, and explain how to run the tests
* If you use anything other than GitHub to manage issues (ex. JIRA or Trac), let them know which tools theyâ€™ll need to contribute

### Report a Security Vulnerability

> If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email bryan.haines@yahoo.com, instead.

In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:
* Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I disable something for other people?

> If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just email us at bryan.haines@yahoo.com.

> When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

### Report a Bug

>1. What version of InQuick are you using?
2. What operating system and browser are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

> General questions should go to bryan.haines@yahoo.com.

### Suggest a Feature or Enhancement

> Our concept is to provide ease of access for healthcare recipients, while always keeping security foremost in our concerns.

> If you think of a feature that you would appreciate in InQuick that doesn't exist, you are probably not alone. Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

### Code review process

> Pull Requests will be reviewed on a weekly basis.
> After feedback has been given, responses should be given in a timely manner. After a reasonable amount of time with no response, the pull request may be closed.
